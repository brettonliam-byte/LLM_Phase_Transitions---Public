          "content": "## Step 1: Identify the integral to be solved\nThe given integral is ∫((tan(ln(x)))^3)/x dx. This involves the tangent function and the natural logarithm, indicating a potential substitution could simplify the integral.\n\n## Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution\nLet's use the substitution u = ln(x), which implies du = 1/x dx. This substitution can simplify the integral because it directly addresses the ln(x) within the tangent function.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the substitution to the integral\nWith u = ln(x), the integral transforms into ∫(tan(u))^3 du. This is because (tan(ln(x)))^3 becomes (tan(u))^3 and 1/x dx becomes du.\n\n## Step 4: Express (tan(u))^3 in terms of sin(u) and cos(u)\nRecall that tan(u) = sin(u)/cos(u). Therefore, (tan(u))^3 = (sin(u)/cos(u))^3 = (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3.\n\n## Step 5: Use trigonometric identities to simplify the integral\nThe expression (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 can be rewritten as (sin(u))^3 * (cos(u))^-3. Recall the identity sin(3u) = 3sin(u) - 4sin^3(u) and the relationship between tan(u) and the sine and cosine functions, but a more direct approach involves recognizing the integral as a form that can be simplified using the substitution v = cos(u), which leads to dv = -sin(u) du.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the substitution v = cos(u) to simplify the integral further\nLet v = cos(u), then dv = -sin(u) du, or sin(u) du = -dv. The integral ∫(sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 du becomes ∫-(v^3) / (v^3) dv = -∫(1/v^3) dv, but this step was incorrectly simplified. Correctly, it should transform into ∫-(1 - v^2) / v^3 dv because (sin(u))^2 = 1 - (cos(u))^2.\n\n## Step 7: Correctly simplify and integrate\nThe correct transformation after substitution should directly address (tan(u))^3. A more straightforward approach to integrate (tan(u))^3 du involves recognizing it as tan^3(u) = (sec^2(u) - 1) * tan(u), which simplifies the integration process by using trigonometric identities directly applicable to tan(u).\n\n## Step 8: Apply the correct trigonometric identity for tan^3(u)\nUsing the identity tan^3(u) = (sec^2(u) - 1) * tan(u), and knowing that sec^2(u) = 1 + tan^2(u), we can proceed with the integration by parts or substitution that fits this form. However, a direct integration approach considering tan^3(u) as (tan(u)) * (tan^2(u)) and utilizing the relationship tan^2(u) = sec^2(u) - 1 is more efficient.\n\n## Step 9: Integrate using the correct approach for tan^3(u)\nTo integrate tan^3(u) du, let's use the identity tan^2(u) = sec^2(u) - 1, thus tan^3(u) = tan(u) * (sec^2(u) - 1). This can be integrated by recognizing that the derivative of tan(u) is sec^2(u), which directly relates to part of our integral.\n\n## Step 10: Perform the integration\n∫tan^3(u) du can be approached by recognizing it as ∫tan(u) * (sec^2(u) - 1) du. Let's focus on integrating this expression directly: ∫tan(u) * sec^2(u) du - ∫tan(u) du. The first part directly integrates to tan^2(u)/2 (considering the substitution and the derivative of tan(u)), and the second part integrates to -ln|cos(u)|.\n\n## Step 11: Combine the results of the integration\nAfter integrating, we have (1/2)tan^2(u) - (-ln|cos(u)|) + C, which simplifies to (1/2)tan^2(u) + ln|cos(u)| + C.\n\n## Step 12: Substitute back to the original variable\nRecall that u = ln(x), so we substitute back to express the solution in terms of x: (1/2)(tan(ln(x)))^2 + ln|cos(ln(x))| + C.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1/2)(tan(ln(x)))^2 + ln|cos",
