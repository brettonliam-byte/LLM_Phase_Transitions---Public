This involves the tangent function and the natural logarithm, indicating a potential substitution could simplify the integral.\n\n## Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution\nLet's use the substitution u = ln(x), which implies du/dx = 1/x. Therefore, du = (1/x)dx, or dx = xdu. Since u = ln(x), we can express x as e^u.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the substitution to the integral\nSubstituting u = ln(x) and dx = e^u du into the integral, we get ∫((tan(u))^3)e^u du. However, we should express everything in terms of u, including the denominator of the original integral, which was x. Since x = e^u, the integral becomes ∫(tan(u))^3 * e^u / e^u du.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the integral\nThe e^u terms cancel out, simplifying the integral to ∫(tan(u))^3 du.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the integral of (tan(u))^3\nTo integrate (tan(u))^3, we can use the identity tan^2(u) = sec^2(u) - 1. Thus, (tan(u))^3 = tan(u)(sec^2(u) - 1). The integral then becomes ∫tan(u)(sec^2(u) - 1)du.\n\n## Step 6: Break down the integral into manageable parts\nThis can be broken down into two integrals: ∫tan(u)sec^2(u)du - ∫tan(u)du.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the first integral\nFor ∫tan(u)sec^2(u)du, let's use the substitution v = sec(u), which implies dv/du = sec(u)tan(u), or dv = sec(u)tan(u)du. This transforms the integral into ∫v dv.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the integral of v dv\nThe integral of v dv is (v^2)/2 + C1, where C1 is a constant of integration. Substituting back v = sec(u), we get (sec^2(u))/2 + C1.\n\n## Step 9: Solve the second integral\nThe integral of -∫tan(u)du is -ln|sec(u)| + C2, where C2 is another constant of integration.\n\n## Step 10: Combine the results of the two integrals\nCombining the results, we have (sec^2(u))/2 - ln|sec(u)| + C, where C = C1 + C2.\n\n## Step 11: Substitute back for u\nSince u = ln(x), we substitute back to express the solution in terms of x: (sec^2(ln(x)))/2 - ln|sec(ln(x))| + C.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify if possible\nGiven the complexity of the expression and the nature of the original problem, further simplification may not yield a significantly more manageable form without specific trigonometric identities that simplify sec^2(ln(x)) or ln|sec(ln(x))| directly.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(sec^2(ln(x)))/2 - ln|sec(ln(x))| + C}$",
