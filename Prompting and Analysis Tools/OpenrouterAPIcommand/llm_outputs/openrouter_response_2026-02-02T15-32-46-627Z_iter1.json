          "content": "## Step 1: Identify the integral to be solved\nThe given integral is ∫((tan(ln(x)))^3)/x dx. This involves the tangent function and the natural logarithm, indicating a potential substitution could simplify the integral.\n\n## Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution\nLet's use the substitution u = ln(x), which implies du = 1/x dx. This substitution can simplify the integral because it directly addresses the ln(x) within the tangent function.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the substitution to the integral\nWith u = ln(x), the integral becomes ∫(tan(u))^3 du. This is because the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, which is part of the original integral, allowing us to directly substitute without needing to adjust the integral further for the substitution.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the integral of (tan(u))^3\nTo integrate (tan(u))^3, we can use the identity tan^3(u) = tan(u) * (sec^2(u) - 1). However, a more straightforward approach involves recognizing that tan(u) is the derivative of -ln(cos(u)), suggesting a potential substitution or integration by parts. But, directly, we can use the formula for ∫tan^n(x) dx, which for odd n, can be reduced using trigonometric identities.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the formula or reduction for ∫tan^3(u) du\nThe formula for ∫tan^3(u) du can be derived from the reduction formula or directly using trigonometric identities. One approach is to use tan^3(u) = tan(u)(sec^2(u) - 1), then apply integration by parts or recognize the derivative of a function that leads to a simpler integral.\n\n## Step 6: Derive the integral of tan^3(u)\nUsing the identity tan^3(u) = tan(u)(sec^2(u) - 1), and knowing that the derivative of -ln(cos(u)) is tan(u), we can proceed with integration by parts or substitution. However, a direct approach recognizes that ∫tan^3(u) du can be simplified by using the trigonometric identity and then integrating the resulting expression.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify and solve the integral\n∫tan^3(u) du = ∫tan(u)(sec^2(u) - 1) du. Let's simplify this by recognizing that sec^2(u) - 1 = tan^2(u), thus ∫tan^3(u) du = ∫tan(u) * tan^2(u) du. This can be further simplified using the substitution v = tan(u), dv = sec^2(u) du, but recognizing the relationship between tan(u) and sec^2(u) allows a more direct approach.\n\n## Step 8: Finalize the integral solution\nGiven the complexity of directly integrating tan^3(u), a simpler step involves recognizing the integral can be solved by parts or by recognizing the derivative of a function that matches the integral. The integral of tan^3(u) can be solved by recognizing it as part of a derivative, specifically related to -ln(cos(u)) and its relationship with tan(u).\n\n## Step 9: Directly solve ∫tan^3(u) du\nA direct solution involves recognizing ∫tan^3(u) du = ∫tan(u)(sec^2(u) - 1) du, which simplifies to ∫tan(u)sec^2(u) du - ∫tan(u) du. The first part, ∫tan(u)sec^2(u) du, can be solved by substitution, letting v = tan(u), dv = sec^2(u) du, resulting in ∫v dv. The second part, ∫tan(u) du, is -ln(cos(u)).\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the final integral\n∫v dv = (1/2)v^2 + C, substituting back v = tan(u), we get (1/2)tan^2(u) + C. For the second part, -∫tan(u) du = ln(cos(u)) + C. Combining these, ∫tan^3(u) du = (1/2)tan^2(u) + ln(cos(u)) + C.\n\n## Step 11: Substitute back to the original variable\nGiven u = ln(x), we substitute back to find the solution in terms of x. So, (1/2)tan^2(ln(x)) + ln(cos(ln(x))) + C.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1/2)tan^2(ln(x)) + ln(cos(ln(x))) + C}$",
