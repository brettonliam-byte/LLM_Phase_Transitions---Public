This involves the tangent function and the natural logarithm, indicating a potential substitution could simplify the integral.\n\n## Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution\nLet's use the substitution u = ln(x), which implies du = 1/x dx. This substitution can simplify the integral because it directly addresses the ln(x) within the tangent function.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the substitution to the integral\nWith u = ln(x), the integral becomes ∫(tan(u))^3 du. This is because (tan(ln(x)))^3 becomes (tan(u))^3 and 1/x dx becomes du.\n\n## Step 4: Express (tan(u))^3 in terms of sin(u) and cos(u)\nRecall that tan(u) = sin(u)/cos(u). Therefore, (tan(u))^3 = (sin(u)/cos(u))^3 = (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3.\n\n## Step 5: Use trigonometric identities to simplify the integral\nThe expression (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 can be rewritten as (sin(u))^3 * (cos(u))^-3. Recall the identity sin(3u) = 3sin(u) - 4sin^3(u) and the relationship between sine and cosine functions, but a more direct approach involves recognizing the integral as a form that can be simplified using the substitution v = cos(u), which leads to dv = -sin(u) du.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the substitution v = cos(u) to simplify the integral further\nLet v = cos(u), then dv = -sin(u) du, or sin(u) du = -dv. The integral ∫(sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 du becomes ∫-(v^3) / (v^3) dv = -∫(1/v^3) dv, but this step was incorrectly simplified. Correctly, it should transform into ∫-(1 - v^2) / v^3 dv, because sin^2(u) + cos^2(u) = 1, thus sin^2(u) = 1 - cos^2(u), and sin(u) du = -dv.\n\n## Step 7: Correctly simplify the integral after substitution\nThe correct transformation after substituting v = cos(u) into ∫(sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 du is ∫-(1 - v^2) / v^3 dv, which can be broken down into ∫-1/v^3 dv + ∫v^-1 dv.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the simplified integral\nSolving ∫-1/v^3 dv + ∫v^-1 dv gives -∫v^-3 dv + ∫v^-1 dv = 1/(2v^2) + ln|v| + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute back to the original variable\nSubstituting back v = cos(u) and recalling u = ln(x), we get 1/(2(cos(ln(x)))^2) + ln|cos(ln(x))| + C.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the final expression if necessary\nThe expression 1/(2(cos(ln(x)))^2) + ln|cos(ln(x))| + C is already simplified in terms of the original variable x.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\cos^2(\\ln(x))} + \\ln|\\cos(\\ln(x))| + C}$",
