          "content": "## Step 1: Identify the integral to be solved\nThe given integral is ∫((tan(ln(x)))^3)/x dx. This involves the tangent function and the natural logarithm, indicating a potential substitution could simplify the integral.\n\n## Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution\nLet's use the substitution u = ln(x), which implies du = 1/x dx. This substitution can simplify the integral because it directly addresses the ln(x) within the tangent function.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the substitution to the integral\nWith u = ln(x), the integral transforms into ∫(tan(u))^3 du. This is because (tan(ln(x)))^3 becomes (tan(u))^3 and 1/x dx becomes du.\n\n## Step 4: Express (tan(u))^3 in terms of sin(u) and cos(u)\nRecall that tan(u) = sin(u)/cos(u). Therefore, (tan(u))^3 = (sin(u)/cos(u))^3 = (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3.\n\n## Step 5: Use trigonometric identities to simplify the integral\nThe expression (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 can be rewritten as (sin(u))^3 * (cos(u))^-3. Recall the identity sin(3u) = 3sin(u) - 4sin^3(u) and the relationship between tan(u) and the sine and cosine functions, but a more direct approach involves recognizing the integral as a form that can be simplified using the substitution v = cos(u), which leads to dv = -sin(u) du.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the substitution v = cos(u) to simplify the integral further\nLet v = cos(u), then dv = -sin(u) du, or sin(u) du = -dv. The integral ∫(sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 du becomes ∫-(v^3) / (v^3) dv = -∫(1/v^3) dv, but this step was incorrectly simplified. Correctly, we should approach the integral of (tan(u))^3 by considering it as tan^3(u) and using the identity tan^2(u) + 1 = sec^2(u) to simplify the expression before integrating.\n\n## Step 7: Correctly simplify (tan(u))^3\nUsing the identity tan^2(u) + 1 = sec^2(u), we can express tan^3(u) in terms of sec(u) and tan(u) for easier integration. However, a more straightforward approach to integrate tan^3(u) involves recognizing it as tan(u) * tan^2(u) and using the relation tan^2(u) = sec^2(u) - 1.\n\n## Step 8: Integrate tan^3(u) using the correct approach\nThe integral of tan^3(u) can be approached by first expressing tan^3(u) as tan(u) * (sec^2(u) - 1), then integrating term by term. This simplifies to ∫(tan(u) * sec^2(u) - tan(u)) du.\n\n## Step 9: Solve the integral\nThe integral ∫(tan(u) * sec^2(u) - tan(u)) du can be broken down into two parts: ∫(tan(u) * sec^2(u)) du - ∫tan(u) du. The first part, ∫(tan(u) * sec^2(u)) du, can be solved by recognizing that the derivative of sec(u) is sec(u) * tan(u), implying the integral is related to sec(u). The second part, ∫tan(u) du, is a standard integral that results in -ln|cos(u)|.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate each part of the integral\nFor ∫(tan(u) * sec^2(u)) du, let's consider the relationship with sec(u); the integral of sec^2(u) is tan(u), but since we have tan(u) * sec^2(u), it's more about recognizing the structure as related to the derivative of sec(u), thus it integrates to sec(u) + C1. For ∫tan(u) du, it integrates to -ln|cos(u)| + C2.\n\n## Step 11: Combine the results of the integration\nCombining the results, we get sec(u) - ln|cos(u)| + C, where C = C1 + C2.\n\n## Step 12: Substitute back to the original variable\nRecall that u = ln(x), so we substitute back to get sec(ln(x)) - ln|cos(ln(x))| + C.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{sec(ln(x)) - ln|cos(ln(x))| + C}$",
