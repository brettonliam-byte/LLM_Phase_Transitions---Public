          "content": "## Step 1: Identify the integral to be solved\nThe given integral is ∫((tan(ln(x)))^3)/x dx. This involves the tangent function and the natural logarithm, indicating a potential substitution could simplify the integral.\n\n## Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution\nLet's use the substitution u = ln(x), which implies du = 1/x dx. This substitution can simplify the integral because it directly addresses the ln(x) within the tangent function.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the substitution to the integral\nWith u = ln(x), the integral transforms into ∫(tan(u))^3 du. This is because (tan(ln(x)))^3 becomes (tan(u))^3 and 1/x dx becomes du.\n\n## Step 4: Express (tan(u))^3 in terms of sin(u) and cos(u)\nRecall that tan(u) = sin(u)/cos(u). Therefore, (tan(u))^3 = (sin(u)/cos(u))^3 = (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3.\n\n## Step 5: Use trigonometric identities to simplify the integral\nThe expression (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 can be rewritten as (sin(u))^3 * (cos(u))^-3. Recall the identity sin(3u) = 3sin(u) - 4sin^3(u) and the relationship between sine and cosine functions, but a more direct approach involves recognizing the integral as a form that can be simplified using the substitution v = cos(u), which leads to dv = -sin(u) du.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the substitution v = cos(u) to simplify the integral further\nLet v = cos(u), then dv = -sin(u) du, or sin(u) du = -dv. The integral ∫(sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 du becomes ∫-(v^3) / (v^3) dv = -∫(1/v^3) dv, but this step was incorrectly simplified. Correctly, it should transform into ∫-(1 - v^2) / v^3 dv, because sin^2(u) + cos^2(u) = 1, implying sin^2(u) = 1 - cos^2(u) and thus sin(u) du = -dv, leading to the correct substitution for sin^3(u) as (1 - v^2) * -dv.\n\n## Step 7: Correctly simplify and integrate\nThe correct simplification after substitution should focus on the original goal of simplifying (tan(u))^3. A more straightforward approach to integrate (tan(u))^3 du involves recognizing it as tan^3(u) = (sec^2(u) - 1) * tan(u), which simplifies the integration process by using trigonometric identities directly applicable to tan(u).\n\n## Step 8: Apply the correct trigonometric identity for tan^3(u)\nUsing the identity tan^3(u) = (sec^2(u) - 1) * tan(u), the integral becomes ∫(sec^2(u) - 1) * tan(u) du. This can be split into ∫sec^2(u) * tan(u) du - ∫tan(u) du.\n\n## Step 9: Solve the split integrals\nFor ∫sec^2(u) * tan(u) du, let's use the substitution w = tan(u), which implies dw = sec^2(u) du. This transforms the integral into ∫w dw = (w^2)/2 + C1. Substituting back, we get (tan^2(u))/2 + C1. For ∫tan(u) du, recall that the integral of tan(u) is -ln|cos(u)| + C2.\n\n## Step 10: Combine the results of the split integrals\nCombining the results, we have (tan^2(u))/2 - ln|cos(u)| + C, where C = C1 + C2.\n\n## Step 11: Substitute back to the original variable\nRecall that u = ln(x), so tan(u) = tan(ln(x)) and cos(u) = cos(ln(x)). Substituting back, the solution becomes (tan^2(ln(x)))/2 - ln|cos(ln(x))| + C.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(tan^2(ln(x)))/2 - ln|cos(ln(x))| + C}$",
