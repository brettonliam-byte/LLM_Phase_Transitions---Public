          "content": "## Step 1: Identify the integral to be solved\nThe given integral is ∫((tan(ln(x)))^3)/x dx. This involves the tangent function and the natural logarithm, indicating a potential substitution could simplify the integral.\n\n## Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution\nLet's use the substitution u = ln(x), which implies du = 1/x dx. This substitution can simplify the integral because it directly addresses the ln(x) within the tangent function.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the substitution to the integral\nWith u = ln(x), the integral becomes ∫(tan(u))^3 du. This is because (tan(ln(x)))^3 becomes (tan(u))^3 and 1/x dx becomes du.\n\n## Step 4: Express (tan(u))^3 in terms of sin(u) and cos(u)\nRecall that tan(u) = sin(u)/cos(u). Therefore, (tan(u))^3 = (sin(u)/cos(u))^3 = (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3.\n\n## Step 5: Use trigonometric identities to simplify the integral\nThe expression (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 can be rewritten as (sin(u))^3 * (cos(u))^-3. Recall the identity sin(3u) = 3sin(u) - 4sin^3(u) and the relationship between sine and cosine functions, but a more direct approach involves recognizing the integral as a form that can be simplified using the substitution v = cos(u), which leads to dv = -sin(u) du.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the substitution v = cos(u) to simplify the integral further\nLet v = cos(u), then dv = -sin(u) du, or sin(u) du = -dv. The integral ∫(sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 du becomes ∫-(v^3) / (v^3) dv = -∫(1/v^3) dv, but this step was incorrectly simplified. Correctly, it should transform into ∫-(1 - v^2) / v^3 dv, because (sin(u))^2 = 1 - (cos(u))^2, and thus (sin(u))^3 = sin(u)*(1 - (cos(u))^2).\n\n## Step 7: Correctly simplify and integrate\nThe correct transformation after substitution should directly address (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3. Using v = cos(u), we have sin(u) du = -dv, and (sin(u))^2 = 1 - v^2. So, the integral becomes ∫-(1 - v^2) / v^3 dv.\n\n## Step 8: Perform the integration\nTo integrate ∫-(1 - v^2) / v^3 dv, break it into two integrals: -∫(1/v^3) dv + ∫(1/v) dv. The first integral, -∫(1/v^3) dv, becomes 1/(2v^2) + C1, and the second integral, ∫(1/v) dv, becomes ln|v| + C2.\n\n## Step 9: Combine the results of integration and back-substitute\nCombining the results gives 1/(2v^2) + ln|v| + C. Now, back-substitute v = cos(u) and then u = ln(x) to express the solution in terms of x.\n\n## Step 10: Back-substitution to express the solution in terms of x\nSubstituting back v = cos(u) gives 1/(2(cos(u))^2) + ln|cos(u)| + C. Then, substituting u = ln(x) yields 1/(2(cos(ln(x)))^2) + ln|cos(ln(x))| + C.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1/(2(cos(ln(x)))^2) + ln|cos(ln(x))| + C}$",
