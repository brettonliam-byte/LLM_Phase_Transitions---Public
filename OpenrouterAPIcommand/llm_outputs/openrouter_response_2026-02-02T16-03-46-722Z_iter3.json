          "content": "## Step 1: Identify the integral to be solved\nThe given integral is ∫((tan(ln(x)))^3)/x dx. This involves the tangent function and the natural logarithm, indicating a potential substitution could simplify the integral.\n\n## Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution\nLet's use the substitution u = ln(x), which implies du = 1/x dx. This substitution can simplify the integral because it directly addresses the ln(x) within the tangent function.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the substitution to the integral\nWith u = ln(x), the integral becomes ∫(tan(u))^3 du. This is because (tan(ln(x)))^3 becomes (tan(u))^3 and 1/x dx becomes du.\n\n## Step 4: Express (tan(u))^3 in terms of sin(u) and cos(u)\nRecall that tan(u) = sin(u)/cos(u). Therefore, (tan(u))^3 = (sin(u)/cos(u))^3 = (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3.\n\n## Step 5: Use trigonometric identities to simplify the integral\nThe expression (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 can be rewritten as (sin(u))^3 * (cos(u))^-3. Recall the identity for sin(3u) and the relationship between tan(u) and the sine and cosine functions, but directly integrating (tan(u))^3 involves recognizing it as part of a derivative pattern related to tan(u).\n\n## Step 6: Integrate (tan(u))^3\nTo integrate (tan(u))^3, we can use the identity (tan(u))^3 = tan(u) * (sec(u))^2 - tan(u), derived from the trigonometric identity for the derivative of tan(u) and recognizing that the derivative of tan(u) is (sec(u))^2. However, a more straightforward approach involves recognizing the integral of (tan(u))^3 can be solved by parts or by recognizing a reduction formula. A simpler method to integrate (tan(u))^3 directly is to use the substitution or recognize the pattern related to the derivative of tan(u), but a common approach involves using the reduction formula or integrating by parts with a clever choice of u and dv.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the reduction formula or integrate by parts\nFor (tan(u))^3, let's simplify by recognizing a pattern: ∫(tan(u))^3 du can be approached by using the identity tan(u) = sin(u)/cos(u) and then applying integration by parts or recognizing a standard integral form. However, a direct and efficient method to solve ∫(tan(u))^3 du involves recognizing it as part of a standard integral that results in -1/2 * (1/(cos(u))^2) + 1/2 * ln|(cos(u))/(1 + (sin(u))^2)| or more directly, using the formula ∫(tan(u))^n du for odd n, which simplifies to -1/(n-1) * (1/(cos(u))^(n-1)) + ∫(tan(u))^(n-2) du for n odd.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the simplified integral\nGiven n=3 (odd), ∫(tan(u))^3 du simplifies to -1/2 * (1/(cos(u))^2) + ∫(tan(u)) du. The integral of tan(u) is -ln|cos(u)|.\n\n## Step 9: Combine the results of the integration\nSo, ∫(tan(u))^3 du = -1/2 * (1/(cos(u))^2) - ln|cos(u)| + C.\n\n## Step 10: Substitute back to the original variable\nRecall u = ln(x), so we substitute back to get the solution in terms of x: -1/2 * (1/(cos(ln(x)))^2) - ln|cos(ln(x))| + C.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the expression if possible\nThe expression -1/2 * (1/(cos(ln(x)))^2) - ln|cos(ln(x))| + C is already simplified in terms of x.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2} \\sec^2(\\ln(x)) - \\ln|\\cos(\\ln(x))| + C}$",
