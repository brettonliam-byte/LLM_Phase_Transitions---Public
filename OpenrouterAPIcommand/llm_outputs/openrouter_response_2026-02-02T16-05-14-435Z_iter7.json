This involves the tangent function and the natural logarithm, indicating a potential substitution could simplify the integral.\n\n## Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution\nLet's use the substitution u = ln(x), which implies du = 1/x dx. This substitution can simplify the integral because it directly addresses the ln(x) within the tangent function.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the substitution to the integral\nWith u = ln(x), the integral transforms into ∫(tan(u))^3 du. This is because (tan(ln(x)))^3 becomes (tan(u))^3 and 1/x dx becomes du.\n\n## Step 4: Express (tan(u))^3 in terms of sin(u) and cos(u)\nRecall that tan(u) = sin(u)/cos(u). Therefore, (tan(u))^3 = (sin(u)/cos(u))^3 = (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3.\n\n## Step 5: Use trigonometric identities to simplify the integral\nThe expression (sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 can be rewritten as (sin(u))^3 * (cos(u))^-3. Recall the identity sin(3u) = 3sin(u) - 4sin^3(u) and the relationship between tan(u) and the sine and cosine functions, but a more direct approach involves recognizing the integral as a form that can be simplified using the substitution v = cos(u), which leads to dv = -sin(u) du.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the substitution v = cos(u) to simplify the integral further\nLet v = cos(u), then dv = -sin(u) du, or sin(u) du = -dv. The integral ∫(sin(u))^3 / (cos(u))^3 du becomes ∫-(v^3) / (v^3) dv = -∫(1/v^3) dv, but this step was incorrectly simplified. Correctly, we should approach the integral of (tan(u))^3 by considering it as tan^3(u) and using the identity tan^2(u) + 1 = sec^2(u) to simplify the expression before integrating.\n\n## Step 7: Correctly simplify (tan(u))^3\nUsing the identity tan^2(u) + 1 = sec^2(u), we can express tan^3(u) in terms of sec(u) and tan(u) for easier integration. However, a more straightforward approach to integrate tan^3(u) involves recognizing it as tan(u) * tan^2(u) and using the relation tan^2(u) = sec^2(u) - 1.\n\n## Step 8: Integrate tan^3(u) using the correct approach\nThe integral of tan^3(u) can be approached by first expressing tan^3(u) as tan(u) * (sec^2(u) - 1), then integrating term by term. The integral becomes ∫tan(u) * sec^2(u) du - ∫tan(u) du.\n\n## Step 9: Solve the integrals\nFor ∫tan(u) * sec^2(u) du, let's consider the substitution w = tan(u), which implies dw = sec^2(u) du. This transforms the integral into ∫w dw. The second integral, ∫tan(u) du, is known to be -ln|cos(u)| + C.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the integrals\n∫w dw = (w^2)/2 + C1, where C1 is a constant of integration. Substituting back w = tan(u), we get (tan^2(u))/2 + C1. The second integral, -ln|cos(u)| + C2, where C2 is another constant of integration.\n\n## Step 11: Combine the results and substitute back for u\nCombining the results, we have (tan^2(u))/2 - ln|cos(u)| + C, where C = C1 + C2. Now, substitute back u = ln(x) to express the solution in terms of x.\n\n## Step 12: Express the final solution in terms of x\nSubstituting u = ln(x) back into the solution, we get (tan^2(ln(x)))/2 - ln|cos(ln(x))| + C.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(tan^2(ln(x)))/2 - ln|cos(ln(x))| + C}$",
