Model,Shape,Architecture & In-Depth Capability Analysis
Olmo 3.1 32B Think,Straight Line,"32B Dense (RL-Tuned): Its ""Think"" process is the key differentiator. The transcript shows it actively hypothesizing ""catenary"" and then rejecting it via force balance. Lesson: RL-based ""thinking"" beats raw parameter scale for physics."
gpt-oss-120b,Straight Line,"117B MoE (Math-Specialized): A Mixture-of-Experts model trained specifically on STEM data. Its ""expert"" routing likely directed the query to a math-logic module rather than a creative writing module, ensuring derivation over description."
Tongyi DeepResearch,Straight Line,30B MoE (Agentic): Designed to synthesize answers from first principles (like a search agent). It treats physics as a logic puzzle to be solved from scratch rather than a text completion task.
DeepSeek R1T Chimera,Straight Line,"671B MoE (R1-Hybrid): Merges the reasoning logic of DeepSeek-R1 with the general knowledge of V3. The ""Chimera"" architecture successfully routes the physics query to reasoning experts, avoiding the hallucination traps of standard 600B+ models."
DeepSeek R1T2 Chimera,Straight Line,"671B MoE (R1-Hybrid): Identical performance to R1T. Proves that the ""Assembly of Experts"" method is stable and reproducible for high-level physics derivation."
Nemotron Nano 12B VL,Straight Line,"12B Hybrid (Transformer-Mamba): The Mamba (State Space Model) component excels at maintaining long-range sequential logic, allowing it to ""hold"" the variable definitions through the derivation better than standard Transformers of this size."
Nemotron Nano 9B V2,Straight Line,"9B Hybrid (Reasoning): A testament to high-quality data. Despite being small, it was trained on synthetic reasoning traces, effectively ""memorizing"" how to derive physics rather than just memorizing facts."
Qwen3 235B A22B,Straight Line,"235B MoE (Thinking Mode): The ""Thinking"" tag indicates a system prompt or fine-tune that encourages step-by-step verification, which correctly identified the ""apparent gravity"" vector."
Grok 4.1 Fast,Straight Line,"Reasoning Model: Likely utilizes a ""CoT-first"" inference strategy, ensuring the math (tanθ=const) is calculated before the text is generated."
gpt-oss:20b,Straight Line,"20B Reasoning: A smaller, focused model. It outperformed 400B+ generalists because it lacks the ""creative writing"" bulk that often dilutes logic in larger models."

Kimi K2 0711,Curved,"1T MoE (Long Context): Massive scale often leads to over-complication. Kimi ""knew"" so much about drag coefficients and variable atmosphere that it refused to accept the simple ""uniform drag"" assumption, leading to a ""hockey stick"" curve."
GLM 4.5 Air,Catenary-like,"100B+ MoE (Agentic): As a generalist agent, it prioritized a descriptive, safe answer (""it's a compromise"") over a risky mathematical derivation."
LongCat Flash Chat,Catenary-like,"Reasoning Model: Failed the final simplification step. It correctly integrated forces but defaulted to a ""curved"" description, likely due to a training bias favoring ""rich"" descriptions over ""simple"" ones."
Mistral Small 24B,Complex,"24B Dense: A classic ""intermediate"" failure. Smart enough to know it's hard, not smart enough to solve it. It admitted the shape was ""mathematically complex"" (it isn't, but it seemed so)."
Cognito V2 70B,Catenary-like,"70B (Distilled): Distillation often preserves the biases of the teacher model. If the teacher (Llama 405B) favors ""catenary,"" the student will too, even if fine-tuned."
Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp,Curved,"Multimodal (Speed): Optimized for low latency. Physics derivation requires ""computation time"" (depth); ""Flash"" models trade this depth for speed, resulting in a qualitative rather than quantitative answer."

Hermes 3 405B,Tractrix,"405B Dense: A case of ""Smart Hallucination."" Large models capture ""rare"" tokens. It mapped the problem to ""Tractrix"" (a pursuit curve), which sounds highly intelligent but is physically irrelevant. High capacity = High reasoning."
Deepseek V3.1 Nex,Dynamic Catenary,"671B MoE: A ""sophisticated failure."" It used LaTeX and formal proofs to justify the wrong answer. This shows that Logic-Fine-Tuning can sometimes just make a model more persuasive at being wrong."
Llama 3.3 70B,Catenary,"70B Dense (Chat): Trained on human dialogue. Humans usually ask about catenaries. The model is aligning with the ""user expectation"" rather than the ""physical reality."""
Cognito V2 405B,Asym. Catenary,"405B Dense: Despite its size, it failed. This highlights that adding parameters (scaling laws) improves knowledge retrieval but does not automatically improve novel deduction."
KAT-Coder-Pro V1,Catenary,"Coding Agent: Code Bias. It likely retrieved a Python snippet for scipy.special.cosh (catenary function) because that's the most common code for cables, ignoring the physics prompt."
Devstral 2 2512,Mod. Catenary,"Coding Model: Similar to KAT, it tried to write a differential equation solver in its head but got stuck in the syntax of the standard catenary problem."
Qwen3 Coder 480B,Concave Up,480B MoE (Coder): Over-engineered the math. It tried to solve a non-linear PDE (like a fluid dynamics sim) and hallucinated a curvature gradient.
Uncensored,Parabola,"Generalist: Analogy Error. It accessed the concept of ""horizontal force"" and mapped it to ""Suspension Bridge"" (Parabola), failing to distinguish between deck load and drag load."
Mistral 7B,Catenary-like,"7B Dense: Small generalist. Lacked the attention span to process the ""drag"" constraint, falling back to the ""gravity-only"" default."
Llama 3.2 3B,Catenary,"3B Lightweight: Mobile-class model. Pure pattern matching. ""Cable"" → ""Catenary."" No compute budget for reasoning."
Trinity Mini,Parabola,"Small Variant: Lacks resolution. It conflated ""drag"" with ""weight,"" leading to a generic curved answer."
"gemma3 (4b, 12b, 27b)",Catenary / Complex,Multimodal Dense: These models are trained on text and images. They likely relied on the Visual Intuition of a sagging line (which looks curved) rather than the invisible math of force vectors.
Qwen3:4b,Parabola,"Small Dense: Hallucinated a standard physics problem solution (projectile motion or suspension bridge) instead of deriving from the specific constraints."
Qwen3:8b,Catenary,"Small Dense: Explicitly stated ""This is getting too vague,"" indicating a Context Collapse where it couldn't maintain the variable relationships."

gemma3:1b,Sine Wave,"1B Tiny: Total Grounding Failure. It associated ""air + moving"" with ""flag waving,"" outputting a sine wave. It shows that <3B models struggle with static vs. dynamic distinction."
Deepseek-r1:8b,Vertical Line,"8B RL (Small): Logic Loop Error. It reasoned ""Line"" correctly, but then reasoned ""Horizontal speed = Helicopter speed → No Relative Speed → No Drag."" It reasoned itself into a false premise due to limited world-knowledge."
