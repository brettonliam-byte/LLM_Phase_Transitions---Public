Llama 3.3 70B Instruct,Catenary,70B Dense: Dialogue-tuned; provided the most common conversational answer.
Deepseek V3.1 Nex N1,Dynamic Catenary,"671B MoE: A ""sophisticated failure."" Used complex math to justify the incorrect ""cosh"" solution."
Hermes 3 405B,Tractrix / Spiral,"405B Generalist: Hallucinated a complex math term (""Tractrix"") irrelevant to the physics."
Cognito V2 405B,Asymmetric Catenary,"405B Dense: Despite scale, it failed to break the ""cable = catenary"" linguistic bias."
KAT-Coder-Pro V1,Catenary,"Coding Agent: Forced the code/math to fit the ""cosh"" function found in code libraries."
Devstral 2 2512,Modified Catenary,Coding Model: Over-complicated the ODEs until they became unsolvable.
