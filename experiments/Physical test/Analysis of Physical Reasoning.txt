Model Name,Predicted Shape,Grade,Architecture & Performance Link
Olmo 3.1 32B Think,Straight Line,A+,"32B parameter dense model optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL) for multi-step reasoning. Its ""Thinking"" transcript shows a self-correcting process that eventually proves the constant slope."
gpt-oss-120b,Straight Line,A+,"117B parameter MoE built for math and logic. It explicitly derived that ""curvature vanishes"" when horizontal force is uniform, correctly distinguishing this from a standard catenary."
Kimi K2 0711,Straight Line,A+,1T parameter MoE focused on agentic intelligence. It successfully bypassed common linguistic patterns to calculate the correct linear force balance.
Nemotron Nano 12B 2 VL,Straight Line,A,12B parameter hybrid Transformer-Mamba model. The hybrid architecture excels at sequential logic; it correctly concluded a straight line inclined at arctan(λg/D).
Nemotron Nano 9B V2,Straight Line,A,"9B parameter dense model. Like its 12B counterpart, it used first-principles reasoning to identify the constant tension ratio."
Qwen3 235B A22B,Straight Line,A,"235B parameter MoE (22B active). It used its ""Thinking Mode"" to derive the answer from scratch, avoiding the ""catenary trap""."
Deepseek R1T Chimera,Straight Line,A-,Merged Reasoning Model combining DeepSeek-R1's logic with V3's scale. It reached the correct answer but with slightly less mathematical rigor than Olmo.
GLM 4.5 Air,Straight Line,A-,Bilingual Reasoning Model. It correctly identified that a steady-state force vector results in a non-curved cable.
gpt-oss:20b,Straight Line,A-,20B Reasoning model. Proved that uniform drag distribution along the arc length results in a fixed angle.
gemma3:4b,Straight Line (Confused),C,"4B Dense model. It mentioned a straight line but struggled with the boundary conditions at the free end, showing the limitations of smaller parameter counts in handling physics constraints."
Tongyi DeepResearch 30B,Asymmetric Curve,D,"30B MoE Search-specialist. It likely synthesized a ""common"" physics answer from its search-centric data rather than performing an internal calculation."
Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp,Neither Catenary nor Straight,D,"Multimodal High-Speed Model. While it correctly identified that standard curves don't fit, it failed to find the straight-line simplification, likely due to its optimization for speed over deep physical reasoning."
Hermes 3 405B Instruct,Spiral / Pursuit Curve,F,"405B parameter dense model. Despite its massive size, it ""hallucinated"" a complex ""tractrix"" solution. This is a ""pattern matching"" failure where the model maps the problem to a sophisticated-sounding but irrelevant concept."
Deepseek V3.1 Nex N1,Dynamic Catenary,F,"671B parameter MoE. It used very confident, professional-sounding logic to justify an incorrect ""cosh"" (catenary) solution. This is a ""sophisticated failure"" common in large-scale models without a dedicated reasoning loop."
Trinity Mini,Parabola,F,"Small Mini variant. It defaulted to the simplest pattern match for ""hanging cable""—the suspension bridge parabola—due to limited parameter capacity."
Devstral 2 2512,Modified Catenary,F,"Mistral-derivative Coding model. It attempted a complex ODE but failed to simplify it, defaulting to the word ""catenary"" because it is the most frequent term in its training data for cables."
KAT-Coder-Pro V1,Catenary,F,"Agentic Code Model. It forced a ""catenary"" solution because ""cosh"" is the most frequent math symbol for cables in its code-heavy training set."
Llama 3.3 70B Instruct,Catenary Curve,F,70B parameter dense chat model. It provided the most common answer found in human-annotated dialogue datasets rather than computing the physics.
Cognito V2 Preview 405B,Asymmetrical Catenary,F,"405B parameter hybrid reasoning model. Despite its scale, it failed to break the linguistic bias of ""cable = catenary."""
Llama 3.2 3B Instruct,Catenary,F,3B parameter lightweight model. Primarily a chat-focused model for on-device use; lacks the depth for physical first-principles derivation.
Mistral 7B Instruct,Catenary-like,F,"7B parameter generalist model. Small size led it to rely on the highest-probability next-token association for ""hanging uniform cable."""
Qwen3 Coder 480B A35B,Concave Upward,F,480B parameter MoE Coder focus. It over-engineered the math and reached an incorrect conclusion that curvature would be greatest at the free end.
Uncensored,Parabolic Curve,F,Generalist Model. Claimed that drag reduces horizontal tension in a way that creates a vertex.
Mistral Small 3.1 24B,Complex Curve,F,"24B Intermediate model. It admitted the problem was ""beyond simple analytical solutions,"" missing the simplification found by the reasoning models."
Gemma 3 12b/27b,Asymmetric Catenary,F,"Multimodal Dense models. They relied on the visual intuition of a ""sagging"" cable rather than mathematical force balance."
gemma3:1b,Sine Wave,F-,"1B parameter tiny model. The most severe hallucination; it claimed air friction creates a ""rolling motion"" and a ""sine wave pattern,"" likely because its tiny parameter count cannot maintain physical grounding."
