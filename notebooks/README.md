# Mathematica Notebooks

This directory contains research and experimentation conducted using Wolfram Mathematica. These notebooks were used for early prototyping of experiments, deciphering tasks, and statistical analysis of model outputs.

## Contents

For each Mathematica notebook (`.nb`), there is a corresponding Markdown (`.md`) export for previewing the logic and results directly on GitHub.

- **`Gemma3_Temp_Caesar`**: An experiment testing various sizes of the Google Gemma 3 model on a Caesar cipher deciphering task across a temperature range of 0.0 to 2.0.
- **`25.11.25`**: Scripts for conducting batch experiments via OpenRouter and Ollama APIs from within Mathematica.
- **`20.10.25` / `17.11.25`**: Earlier experimental logs and analysis code.

## Usage
- **To view**: Read the `.md` versions of the notebooks.
- **To run**: Open the `.nb` files in [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/). You will need an active internet connection if the notebook makes API calls.
